# ChangeLog for scan-tool-mso

## Version 0.08 (2021-11-18)

The C++ standard used during compilation has been raised from C++14 to C++17.
Most compilers should support that by now.

The minimum required CMake version for compiling the project is raised from 2.8
to 3.8.

JSON parsing is now handled by the simdjson library and not by JsonCpp anymore.

## Version 0.07 (2019-10-06)

The C++ standard used during compilation has been raised from C++11 to C++14.
Most compilers should support that by now.

## Version 0.06 (2016-05-15)
  - adjust scan limits for Metadefender public API according to
    https://www.opswat.com/blog/preventing-illegitimate-use-of-metadefender
  - This might be the last update of scan-tool-mso.
    If someone finds a severe bug in scan-tool-mso in the future, then this
    will still get fixed, but do not expect any new features.
    The "original" [scan-tool](../scan-tool/) is a program with similar
    features, but it uses the VirusTotal public API instead of Metadefender.
    Take a look at this program, if you need a tool that still gets updates
    once in a while.

## Version 0.05 (2016-03-31)
  - fix Report::successfulRetrieval() and Report::notFound() so that report
    status is now correct in some rarer cases

## Version 0.04 (2016-03-22)
  - raise file size limit for scans to 140 MB
  - use new *.metadefender.com URLs instead of old *.metascan-online.com URLs
    for scanner requests

## Version 0.03 (2016-02-24)
  - add "burst mode" which does not honour time limits / rate limits

## Version 0.02 (2016-02-20)
  - add option to set custom certificate file for peer verification, similar
    to curl's --cacert option

## Version 0.01 (2016-02-02)
  - initial version (reduced and adjusted copy of scan-tool for VirusTotal)
